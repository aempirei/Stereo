variable sample rate stable up to 44.1KHz
u8 s16 s24 and s32 PCM sample sizes
2 channel (stereo)

This is a PCM audio device driver with support for variable sample rates
and bit sizes in 2-channel stereo. The demo code also comes with a full PCM
WAV file decoder and FAT16 SD CARD access. I haven't worked on this code in 4
years but I have some time right now to fix it up a bit. An interesting fact
about these type of sound device drivers is that they operate using the PWM
function of a special register set, and therefore are effectively Class D
amplifiers or switching power supplies, albiet at low total power. Being quite
accurate, this driver should easily translate into the first stage driving
source and open loop control for a higher power switching device provided the
right output stage.  Just a little more code on top of that, and you should be
able to build a full closed-loop control system since ADC is possible via the
Propeller also.

Use SOX to generate WAV files:

sox -v 0.95 audio.mp3 -c 2 -b 24 -r 42000 -t wav audio.wav

Copy the audio.wav file to a FAT16 SD card in the root directory.

Audio plays on the pins base+0 and base+1, where base is the first parameter to
stereo.start(...) as demonstrated in stereo-demo.spin which currently is set to
pin 8.

Wiring the pins to a high-impedence headphones requires a simple RC filter:
            
          200ohm   220uf
  PIN >---/\/\/\-+-|(---> OUT
                 |
                 +-||---| VSS/GND
                   0.1uf

Wiring an SD card requires 4 pins, which by default has a base of pin 12.
Each pin must go to the SD card and to ground via a resistor:

  PIN >--+--> SDCARD
         |
         +--/\/\/\---| VSS/GND

  BASE+0 => SD 7/DO
  BASE+1 => SD 5/CLK
  BASE+2 => SD 2/DI
  BASE+3 => SD 1/CS

  VSS/GND => SD 3/VSS/GND
  VSS/GND => SD 6/VSS/GND
  VDD     => SD 4/VDD/V+
