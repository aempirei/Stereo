variable sample rate stable up to 44.1KHz
16 bit unsigned
2 channel

this is a PCM unsigned 16-bit 2 channel driver, NOT A WAV PLAYER. This will be a
full stereo WAV player in a few days. I haven't worked on this code in 4 years
but I have some time right now to fix it up a bit.

This code is loosely based on SPIN WAV Player Ver. 1a which only plays mono PCM
WAV audio at 16KHz which was written by Raymond Allen.
