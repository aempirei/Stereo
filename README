variable sample rate stable up to 44.1KHz
16 bit unsigned
2 channel

This is a PCM unsigned 16-bit 2 channel driver, NOT A WAV PLAYER. This will be a
full stereo WAV player in a few days. I haven't worked on this code in 4 years
but I have some time right now to fix it up a bit. An interesting fact about
these type of sound device drivers is that they operate using the PWM function
of a special register set, and therefore are effectively Class D amplifiers or
switching power supplies, albiet at low total power. Being quite accurate, this
driver should easily translate into the first stage driving source and open
loop control for a higher power switching device provided the right output stage.
Just a little more code on top of that, and you should be able to build a full
closed-loop control system since ADC is possible via the Propeller also.

This code is loosely based on SPIN WAV Player Ver. 1a which only plays mono PCM
WAV audio at 16KHz which was written by Raymond Allen.
